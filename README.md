# IntegrationtestingHub: Autonomous Microservice Interaction Verification
Automated testing framework for verifying microservice interactions using AI-driven scenario modeling and chaos engineering principles.

The IntegrationtestingHub is a novel approach to testing microservice interactions, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and chaos engineering principles to ensure robust and resilient system behavior. This framework is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, identifying potential failures and bottlenecks in microservice interactions, and providing actionable insights for improvement.

In today's distributed systems, microservices interact in complex ways, making it challenging to ensure seamless communication and data exchange. Traditional testing methods often fall short, failing to capture the intricacies of these interactions. IntegrationtestingHub addresses this gap by employing AI-driven scenario modeling to generate realistic test cases, and chaos engineering principles to inject faults and failures, simulating real-world conditions.

By using IntegrationtestingHub, developers and QA teams can identify and rectify issues early on, reducing the likelihood of downstream problems and improving overall system reliability. The framework provides a comprehensive testing environment, allowing teams to focus on writing better code, rather than spending hours debugging complex issues.

## Key Features

* **AI-driven scenario modeling**: IntegrationtestingHub utilizes machine learning algorithms to generate realistic test scenarios, mimicking real-world microservice interactions.
* **Chaos engineering principles**: The framework incorporates chaos engineering principles to inject faults, latency, and failures, simulating real-world conditions and ensuring system resilience.
* **Microservice interaction analysis**: IntegrationtestingHub provides in-depth analysis of microservice interactions, identifying bottlenecks, and performance issues.
* **Automated test case generation**: The framework automatically generates test cases based on AI-driven scenario modeling, reducing testing time and effort.
* **Customizable testing environments**: Developers can create custom testing environments, tailored to their specific needs, using IntegrationtestingHub's flexible architecture.

## Technology Stack

* **TypeScript**: IntegrationtestingHub is built using TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
* **Node.js**: The framework leverages Node.js for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, ideal for high-performance testing.
* **TensorFlow.js**: TensorFlow.js is used for AI-driven scenario modeling, enabling fast and efficient machine learning computations.
* **Chaos Monkey**: IntegrationtestingHub incorporates Chaos Monkey, a popular chaos engineering tool, to inject faults and failures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/IntegrationtestingHub.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm run start`

## Configuration

IntegrationtestingHub uses environment variables to configure the testing environment. The following variables can be set:

* `TEST_ENV`: specifies the testing environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
* `MICROSERVICE_URLS`: a comma-separated list of microservice URLs to test
* `TEST_CASE_COUNT`: the number of test cases to generate

Additionally, developers can customize the testing environment by creating a `config.json` file in the project root, with the following structure:

## Usage

IntegrationtestingHub provides a RESTful API for interacting with the testing framework. The following endpoints are available:

* `POST /test`: initiates a new testing session
* `GET /test/:sessionId`: retrieves the status of a testing session
* `GET /test/:sessionId/results`: retrieves the testing results

Example usage:
